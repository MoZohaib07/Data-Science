I leveraged scikit-learn's KMeans clustering for flower species segmentation using the Iris Flower dataset, a popular dataset for machine learning. I used sepal and petal data for the flowers while attempting to accurately identify their species. I deployed the 'elbow method' for estimating an ideal number of clusters. Finally, I compared my solution with the solution dataset to assess the accuracy of KMeans Clustering for this particular problem.
