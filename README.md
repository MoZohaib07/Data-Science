KMeans Clustering on Iris Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating KMeans clustering on the Iris dataset for species segmentation. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, often used for testing algorithms. This project showcases my skills in machine learning, data visualization, and clustering using the sklearn library.

Overview
The notebook performs the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the Iris dataset.
Standardize the dataset to ensure each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.
KMeans Clustering:

Apply KMeans clustering to segment the Iris dataset into three clusters.
Visualize the clustering results using scatter plots and color-coding.
Analysis and Visualization:

Analyze the clustering results.
Evaluate the clustering performance by comparing the predicted clusters with the actual species labels.
Visualize the clusters with various feature pairs to understand the clustering patterns.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn

Installation
To run this notebook, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can install the dependencies using pip:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn sklearn

Results
The clustering analysis revealed that the Iris dataset could be effectively segmented into three clusters, corresponding to the three species of Iris flowers. The notebook includes detailed visualizations illustrating the clustering results, with petal length and width features providing the most accurate segmentation.
